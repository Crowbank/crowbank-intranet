## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Dependencies
1. Database design must be completed before UI development
2. Authentication system is required for most UI development
3. Core models must be complete before business logic implementation
4. File storage solution must be implemented before document handling
5. Business logic must be implemented before external integrations

### Parallel Work Streams
- UI foundation can begin in parallel with business logic development
- Testing framework can be developed alongside early models
- Configuration management can be refined throughout development
- Documentation can be created incrementally alongside features **
